About
=====

My name is Albert, I'm from Barcelona and I'm working as full time Software Developer. I enjoy programming and working on small projects in my spare time, and spending time learning new stuff.

I'm going to use this space to write about technology articles, personal side projects or just stuff it could be useful to someone someday! :)
