In this post I will be going over the what's .NET core and what can it offer to us.

Overview
--------

First of all we need to know what is .NET core exactly. Dotnet Core is a new multi-platform open source framework supported by Microsoft and is based from .NET Framework source code.  

It is designed to run web applications and APIs natively in Windows, Mac and Linux.  

So right now Microsoft is developing 3 different frameworks, .NET Framework, .NET Core and Xamarin (which is also .NET based but it has its own multi-platform implementation based on Mono)


### .NET Full Framework

It's a **monolithic** framework, which you can create any type of application, from console apps to deskto, web, etc...  

The downside is that it will only run on Windows systems.

### .NET Core

This is a new platform, written from scratch. It's lightweight, as we said it's also **multi-platform**, it is designed for **high performance** (even better than the traditional .NET Framework), and is intended for the cloud.  

Right now, we can only create console and web applications and there are still far fewer third-party components (libraries, etc..) for .NET Core than for traditional framework. Still, they are trying to solve this problem unifying libraries for both platforms.

### Xamarin

**Xamarin** was born as Open Source project some years ago with the name of Mono. Then **Miguel De Icaza** started to develop what is now known as Xamarin (built on Mono).  

Microsoft bought Xamarin and they decided to make it free, which right now is included in their IDE Visual Studio.

.NET Core on Linux
------------------

You can see Linux requisites depending on your distribution **[here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/linux-prerequisites){:target="_blank"}**

### Creating a web API project

If we want to create a new webapi project in our current folder, we should use:

```bash
$ dotnet new webapi
```

This will create all the project structure (Controllers folder, csproj, startup.cs and so on...)  

Right now, if we want to download all the necessary NuGet packages (all the dependencies) you can use the following command line:

```bash
$ dotnet restore
```

Then you can build your solution and run it with:

```bash
$ dotnet build
$ dotnet run
```

Therefore you can open chrome to navigate to: **http://localhost:5000/api/values**. This was created by default in **Controllers/ValuesController.cs**.  

The auto-generated controller:

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

namespace FirstAspNetWebApi.Controllers
{
    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    public class ValuesController : Controller
    {
        // GET api/values
        [HttpGet]
        public IEnumerable<string> Get()
        {
            return new string[] { "value1", "value2" };
        }

        // GET api/values/5
        [HttpGet("{id}")]
        public string Get(int id)
        {
            return "value";
        }

        // POST api/values
        [HttpPost]
        public void Post([FromBody]string value)
        {
        }

        // PUT api/values/5
        [HttpPut("{id}")]
        public void Put(int id, [FromBody]string value)
        {
        }

        // DELETE api/values/5
        [HttpDelete("{id}")]
        public void Delete(int id)
        {
        }
    }
}
```

Summary
-------

- **The traditional .NET platform**, with which we can create all kinds of applications. Stable, highly used and with few changes in the horizon.
- **The .NET Core platform**: Microsoft's technology of the future. Already in version 2 and stabilized, it will gradually gain market share and will be more and more used, although for the moment it is behind the previous one. Multi-platform and mainly used to Web development.
- **Xamarin**: the latest acquisition but with many years of history behind it. It allows to create multi-platform applications especially for mobile development (iOS, Android), but also for Mac, Windows 10 and soon for Linux. In a very short time it has grown like the foam.
