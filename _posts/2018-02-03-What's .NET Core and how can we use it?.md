In this post I will be going over the what's .NET core and what can it offer to us.

Overview
--------

First of all we need to know what is .NET core exactly. Dotnet Core is a new multi-platform open source framework supported by Microsoft and is based from .NET Framework source code.  

It is designed to run web applications and APIs natively in Windows, Mac and Linux.  

So right now Microsoft is developing 3 different frameworks, .NET Framework, .NET Core and Xamarin (which is also .NET based but it has its own multi-platform implementation based on Mono)


### .NET Full Framework

It's a monolithic framework, which you can create any type of application, from console apps to deskto, web, etc...  

The downside is that it will only run on Windows systems.

### .NET Core

This is a new platform, written from scratch. It's lightweight, as we said it's also multi-platform, it is designed for high performance (even better than the traditional .NET Framework), and is intended for the cloud.  

Right now, we can only create console and web applications and there are still far fewer third-party components (libraries, etc..) for .NET Core than for traditional framework. Still, they are trying to solve this problem unifying libraries for both platforms.

### Xamarin

Xamarin was born as Open Source project some years ago with the name of Mono. Then Miguel De Icaza started to develop what is now known as Xamarin (built on Mono).  

Microsoft bought Xamarin and made it free, which right now is included in their IDE Visual Studio.

Summary
-------

- **The traditional .NET platform**, with which we can create all kinds of applications. Stable, highly used and with few changes in the horizon.
- **The .NET Core platform**: Microsoft's technology of the future. Already in version 2 and stabilized, it will gradually gain market share and will be more and more used, although for the moment it is behind the previous one. Multi-platform and mainly used to Web development.
- **Xamarin**: the latest acquisition but with many years of history behind it. It allows to create multi-platform applications especially for mobile development (iOS, Android), but also for Mac, Windows 10 and soon for Linux. In a very short time it has grown like the foam.
